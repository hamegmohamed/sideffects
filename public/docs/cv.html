	Hello, I'm a student at the Versailles' University (FR).
	I'm <span class="age">22</span> years old this year, and Computer Science is something that I really like.
	This year (2014-2015) is my last and I'll be graduated with a Master degree.
	These past years at this University were nice as we mostly had great teachers.
	The only thing I can regret is sometimes courses can be very theorical and at the beggining of the formation,
	most of the students complain about not doing practical exercices enough.
	Whatever, I had a lot of laughs :)

	The limits are fews and I almost never feel trapped by any language.
	My most used languages are :

	Drawing was my first passion and I continue to feed it as I find this activity very paceful and relaxing.
	Whenever I have a free time, I grab a paper and a model and I reproduced it with my point of view.
